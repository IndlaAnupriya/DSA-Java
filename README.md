# Reverse Linked List in Java

This is a basic Java program that demonstrates how to create and reverse a singly linked list.

##  Features

- Create a linked list using custom `Node` class
- Insert elements at the end of the list
- Reverse the entire linked list
- Display the list before and after reversal

##  Code Structure

- `Node`: Inner static class representing each node in the linked list
- `insert(int data)`: Adds a new node at the end of the list
- `reverse()`: Reverses the linked list
- `display()`: Prints the list elements

##  Sample Output
Original List:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> null
Reversed List:
40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> null
